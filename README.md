OSS-Games is trying to create quality games with just open-source technologies. This year at OSIG conference by The Linux Foundation we say that there is a big gap between open-source and gaming companies/communities, they don't embrace open-source.

Many game developers or artist are not even familiar with open source tools like Krita, blender or Godot engine. The idea is to showcase the world that open-source has power to create complex games. In this process students or any developer will get to learn open-source technologies and can work on a game project as a team, they will get experience and project that can be showcased on their portfolio. 

Overall OSS-Games is not only helping developers/students to learn and create games without buying expensive softwares like Maya but also helping other open source projects by giving exposure. Once people see game they will get to know what technologies were used , what software were used etc. 

Just knowing that a tool exist is not enough, showcasing with actual demo what it can do is a big plus and when you make combination of technologies with other oss projects you will get a complete project.
